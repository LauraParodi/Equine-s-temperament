## Description
This repository contains an unsupervised clustering methods to identify equine's temperament.
I uploaded the final part of the first study of my master's thesis work. This work, through a pilot study, positioned itself at the intersection of the equestrian world and psychology, 
in a still largely unexplored area. The experimental study followed two main directions: the first study, conducted through the completion of a questionnaire, 
allowed for the delineation of different temperamental profiles of horses using appropriate statistical analyses. 
In the second, qualitative study, the temperamental characteristics of the horses were associated with those of the children through carefully structured observations 
aimed at identifying the most functional matchings in terms of the well-being of the horse-child dyad members. 
Following the observations of the dyads and an analysis of the collected data, the importance of temperament and deep knowledge of one's partner emerged as crucial 
for the relationship within the pair, emphasizing the significance of groundwork as a fundamental experience for expressing emotional life.
